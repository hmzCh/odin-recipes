    <h1>Crepes</h1>
    <img src ="../images/crepes.jpg" alt = "Completed crepes">
    <p>I am a French Canadian from Montreal, this recipe is one of the first ones that I learned as a child growing up and can either be served traditional style with REAL maple syrup on top or cold with ice cream rolled into it and chocolate syrup on top as a dessert.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li> 
           <li>1 egg</li> 
           <li>2 cups milk</li>
        </ul> 
        
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine flour, egg, and milk.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or crepe pan over a medium-high heat. Spray the pan with non-stick cooking spray. Pour about 1/3 cup of batter into the pan, lift the pan and turn it by rotating your wrist, spreading a PAPER THIN amount in the pan. Flip the crepe when it starts to bubble. When it is finished cooking, remove it and repeat this process with the remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
